## Data sets

* Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL)
  * [Caron et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64929-x)
  * the most common pediatric cancer
  * characterized by bone marrow lymphoid precursors
  * that acquire genetic alterations,
  * resulting in disrupted maturation and uncontrollable proliferation 
  * up to 85â€“90% of patients are cured
  * others do not respond to treatment or relapse and die
  * **Aim**: characterise the heterogeneity of gene expression at the cell level, within and between patients
  * **cells**: Bone Marrow Mononuclear cells (BMMCs)

## Samples

Five types of sample are considered:

* B-ALL patients:
  * **'ETV6-RUNX1'**, or 't(12;21)', four patients 
  * **'HHD'**, or 'High hyper diploid', two patients
* T-ALL patients
  * **'PRE-T'**, two patients
* Healthy controls,
  * **Healthy pediatric controls**, three individuals

As the study aims at identifying cell populations, large numbers of cells were sequenced with the droplet-based 10x Chromium assay.

## Analyses

We will follow several steps:

* Sequencing quality check
* Alignment of reads to the human genome with 10x software cellranger
* Quality control (filter poor quality cells and remove uninformative genes)
* UMI count normalisation
* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
* Data set integration
* Clustering
* Identification of cluster marker genes
* Differential expression and abundance between conditions
