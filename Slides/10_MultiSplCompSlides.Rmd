## Outline

Clusters and/or cell types have been identified, we now want to compare sample groups:

* Differential expression - Differences in expression between sample group within a cluster

* Differential abundance - Differences in cell numbers between sample groups within a cluster
  
## Differential Expression

Replicates are samples not cells:

* single cells within a sample are not independent of each other,
* using cells as replicates amounts to studying variation inside an individual
* while we want to study variation across a population

Pseudo-bulk:

* gene expression levels for each cluster in each sample
* are obtained by summing across cells

## Differential expression between conditions

Workflow:

- compute pseudo-bulk count by summing across cells,

  * per cluster and per sample
  
- perform bulk analysis with fewer replicates,

  * for each cluster separately

Method:

- quasi-likelihood (QL) methods from the `edgeR` package

- negative binomial generalized linear model (NB GLM)

  * to handle overdispersed count data
  * in experiments with limited replication

## Differential Expression

Steps:

- Remove samples with very low library sizes, e.g. < 20 cells

  * better normalisation
  
- Remove genes that are lowly expressed,

  * reduces computational work,
  * improves the accuracy of mean-variance trend modelling
  * decreases the severity of the multiple testing correction
  * filter: log-CPM threshold in a minimum number of samples, smallest sample group

- Correct for composition biases

  * by computing normalization factors with the trimmed mean of M-values method
  
- Test whether the log-fold change between sample groups is significantly different from zero

  * estimate the negative binomial (NB) dispersions
  * estimate the quasi-likelihood dispersions, uncertainty and variability of the per-gene variance
  
## Differential Abundance

Aim:

- test for significant changes in per-cluster cell abundance across conditions

Example:

- which cell types are depleted or enriched upon treatment?

Steps:

- Count cells assigned to each label, i.e. cluster or cell type

- Same workflow as for differential expression above,

  * except counts are of cells per label, not of reads per gene 
  
- Share information across labels

  * to improve our estimates of the biological variability in cell abundance between replicates.
